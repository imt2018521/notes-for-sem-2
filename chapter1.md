# COMPUTER NETWORKS AND INTERNET

>This section does not contain everything from the book

### Network Protocols

A protocol defines the format and order of messages exhanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the  transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

>Mastering the field of computer networking is equivalent to understanding the what, why, and how of networking protocols.

### The Network Edge

The computers and other devices connected to the internet are end-system(a.k.a hosts)

Ex:
 >desktop computers, servers.

hosts are divided into two categories:
>clients
>servers

### Access Networks

Access network is the network that physically connects an end system to the first router(a.k.a "edge router") on a path from the end system to any othe distant end system.

### Home Access:DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite

Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access:

1. Digital Subscriber Line(DSL)

2. Cable

#### DSL

A residence obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephne company(telco) that provides its wired local phone access. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer's telco is also its ISP. 

- the DSL modem exchanges digital data with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer(DSLAM) located in telco's local CO

- The home's DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to the CO(telco's central office)

- the analog signals from many such homes are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM

>The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:
> 1. A high-speed downstream channel (50 kHz to 1MHz band) 
> 2. A medium-speed upstream channel (4kHz to 50kHz band)
> 3. An ordinary two-way telephone channel (0 to 4kHz band)
